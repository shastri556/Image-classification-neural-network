Implemented a simple image classification neural network to classify Street House View Numbers (SVHN) based on the k-Nearest Neighbour and a deep neural network.


SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing object recognition algorithms with a requirement on data formatting but comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real-world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images.
